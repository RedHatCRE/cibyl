What is Cibyl?
===============
Cibyl is tool that models CI systems by creating an in-memory representation of CI system/s entities, facilitating a unified query  
"language" w.r.t. to any CI related aspects (e.g. jobs, pipelines, builds). Product plugins enable product entities modeling, thus, extending
querying abilities to spaces that span different product related aspects (e.g. product features, deployment options, package dependencies).

The name Cibyl, a form of Sybil, derived from the Greek sybilla or sibilla. Like a prophetess, Cibyl delve into depths of CI systems
and used for "hidden" info revelation. CI-byl is also a wordplay that reflects the CI concealment domain.
